# About
First Game on Godot following the youtube tutorial, "How to make a Video Game - Godot Beginner Tutorial" <br>
but instead of using the godot language, I will be working through the tutorial in C#


Goals
- Become more familiar with Godot
- Learn the syntax of C# and become more comfortable programming in it
- Be able to take this "base" program and expand on it
- Have fun!


Notes
- Project setting > Rendering > Textures 
  - set default texture filter to "Nearest" to disable the smoothing affect
- Scenes are reusable building blocks
- Nodes are the objects being made
  - (sub nodes) charaistics such as hitbox, what it looks like/sprite
  - (main nodes) actual objects such as player or the camera
- script is the coding aspect
  - behavior/how to act
