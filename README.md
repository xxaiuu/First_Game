# About
First Game on Godot following the youtube tutorial, "How to make a Video Game - Godot Beginner Tutorial" <br>
but instead of using the godot language, I will be working through the tutorial in C#


Goals
- Become more familiar with Godot
- Learn the syntax of C# and become more comfortable programming in it
- Be able to take this "base" program and expand on it
- Have fun!
